### Installing

#### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager

You need a userscript manager such as:

#### Step 2: Get the Script

Just click here:
[vtuberfilter.user.js](https://github.com/oh-ari/vtuberfilter/blob/main/vtuberfilter.user.js)

#### Step 3: Install the Script

1. Open your userscript manager dashboard.

2. Click + to create a new script.
