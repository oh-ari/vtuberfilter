![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f56f7c-547a-4a64-bb7c-cfb200c7d99e)


A nice and simple userscript to allow you to hide/block VTubers you aren't a fan of. All your preferences are stored locally and I've done my best to make it look nice too and semi-fitting of the site.

### Instructions
1. Install TamperMonkey (or GreaseMonkey)
2. Get the script from [here](https://github.com/oh-ari/vtuberfilter/blob/main/vtuberfilter.user.js)!
3. Either 'Create New Script' or open your dashboard on your chosen script handler.
  - Click the '+' button on the Dashboard to enable the new script process stuff.
4. Paste the script into it and save.
5. Open VTuberSchedules.com and you should have a new button in the top right.
6. ???
7. Profit!

If you click the 'Raw' button when viewing the script source, it generally will open up TamperMonkey's 'Add Script' thing to make it easier.

Any updates will be auto-downloaded, if you don't want that, feel free to just remove the @updateURL and @downloadURL!

Any suggestions, post something in 'issues' and I'll sort it.
