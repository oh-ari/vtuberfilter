A simple userscript to hide or block VTubers you aren't a fan of. Your preferences are stored locally, and the UI is designed to fit in with the site seamlessly.

### Features

- Locally stored preferences.

- Clean and intuitive UI.

- Simply type the VTuber to hide and done!

- Semi-integrated with VTuberSchedules.com.

- Easily export and import your hide list to another browser.

- Click to hide if you feel too lazy to type!

- Discord Webhook integration for notifications on your favourite streamers. (All stored locally!)

### Installing

#### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager

You need a userscript manager such as:

- TamperMonkey

- GreaseMonkey

#### Step 2: Get the Script

Just click here:
[vtuberfilter.user.js](https://github.com/oh-ari/vtuberfilter/blob/main/vtuberfilter.user.js)

#### Step 3: Install the Script

1. Open your userscript manager dashboard.

2. Click + to create a new script.

3. Paste the copied script.

4. Save the script.

Alternatively, clicking the Raw button on GitHub usually opens TamperMonkey’s ‘Add Script’ prompt, making installation even easier.

#### Step 4: Enjoy!

Open VTuberSchedules.com.

A new button should appear in the top-right corner.

Use it to customize your filters.

### Discord Webhooks

You should read [Discord's page on Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) if you're unsure how to make one.

Once you do though, simply copy the Webhook URL into the input on the UI and save it and add some streamers you're interested in.

As long as the tab is open, you'll recieve notifications in Discord. You can use the "Background" button so the tab stays active in the background while you do other things.

### Updates

Updates will be automatically downloaded.

If you prefer to disable auto-updates, just remove the @updateURL and @downloadURL lines from the script.
